# A framework for the formal meta-theory of lambda calculi with constants

This project contains a framework with formal theories of alpha-conversion, substitution, reduction (computation) and logical relations (with simple types) for lambda calculi with constants, in first-order abstract syntax and with named variables.
On top of it, there are two formalizations of Girard's proof (from his book "Proofs and Types") of The Strong Normalization Theorem, one for the simply typed lambda calculus and the other for System T.

To compile, download and install:
- Agda version 2.4.2.5 
- Agda's Standard Library version 0.11

This project is based upon the framework in: https://github.com/ernius/formalmetatheory-stoughton
