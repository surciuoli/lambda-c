# A metatheory framework for Lambda-calculi

This project contains a framework with formal theories of alpha-conversion, substitution, reduction and logical relations for Lambda-calculus with constants, in first-order abstract syntax and with named variables.
In addition, there are two formalizations of Girard's of The Strong Normalization Theorem, one for both Simply-typed Lambda-calculus and other for System T.
The framework is entirely written in Agda.

To compile, download and install:
- Agda version 2.4.2.5 
- Agda's Standard Library version 0.11

This project is based upon the code in: https://github.com/ernius/formalmetatheory-stoughton
